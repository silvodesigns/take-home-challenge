#Coding Challenge Prompt

You will be developing a one-page web application that receives JSON data and renders the data into the DOM. You will be using the following API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

You should be able to find the endpoints you need on that page for users, posts, etc.

Using jQuery or vanilla JS you will display each 'USER' in a table. When the user selects a 'USER' in the table, it will display all of the 'POSTS' that were created by that 'USER'. You have full freedom in how you accomplish the above objectives. You also have full freedom as far as design is concerned. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task. Once completed, please upload your code to a Github repo and send us the link via Indeed chat. Having a live version of the project is also encouraged. Good Luck.
